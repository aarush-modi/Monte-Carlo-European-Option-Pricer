# Monte-Carlo-European-Option-Pricer

Basic Monte Carlo option model for European-style options

Computes 1,000,000 simulations using numpy to find the European call price for an option

The computed call price is approximately the Black-Scholes formula (Â± 0.01)

Graphically displays Payoffs vs. Frequency using a histogram, which opens in a new tab
